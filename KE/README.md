You will be required to fill in the identification panel on the front cover of each book
of questionnaires by writing the names and code of various units. In addition you
have to fill the identification details for each questionnaire by writing the codes of
the various units. All these codes are to be obtained from the EA map that you will
be given by your supervisor. All the administrative units i.e. (province, district,
division, location and sub location) and political units’ (constituency and ward)
names and codes will be obtained from the map on the top right hand side. The
codes for the EA are printed within each EA. The EA code is composed of five digits
where the first three digits is the EA number, the fourth digit is the EA type and the
fifth digit is the status. Make sure that you copy the codes and the names correctly.
